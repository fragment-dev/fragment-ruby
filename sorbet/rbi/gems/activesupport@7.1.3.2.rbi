# names, modularized class names to ones without, and class names to foreign
# keys. The default inflections for pluralization, singularization, and
# uncountable words are kept in inflections.rb.
#
# The \Rails core team has stated patches for the inflections library will not
# be accepted in order to avoid breaking legacy applications which may be
# relying on errant inflections. If you discover an incorrect inflection and
# require it for your application or wish to define rules for languages other
# than English, please correct or add them yourself (explained below).

  # The value for <tt>i18n.transliterate.rule</tt> can be a simple Hash that

# = Lazy Load Hooks
#
# LazyLoadHooks allows \Rails to lazily load a lot of components and thus
# making the app boot faster. Because of this feature now there is no need to
# require +ActiveRecord::Base+ at boot time purely to apply
# configuration. Instead a hook is registered that applies configuration once
# +ActiveRecord::Base+ is loaded. Here +ActiveRecord::Base+ is
# used as example but this feature can be applied elsewhere too.
#
# Here is an example where on_load method is called to register a hook.
#
#   initializer 'active_record.initialize_timezone' do
#     ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
#       self.time_zone_aware_attributes = true
#       self.default_timezone = :utc
#     end
#   end
#
# When the entirety of +ActiveRecord::Base+ has been
# evaluated then run_load_hooks is invoked. The very last line of
# +ActiveRecord::Base+ is:
#
#   ActiveSupport.run_load_hooks(:active_record, ActiveRecord::Base)
#
# run_load_hooks will then execute all the hooks that were registered
# with the on_load method. In the case of the above example, it will
# execute the block of code that is in the +initializer+.
#
# Registering a hook that has already run results in that hook executing
# immediately. This allows hooks to be nested for code that relies on
# multiple lazily loaded components:
#
#   initializer "action_text.renderer" do
#     ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_controller_base) do
#       ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_text_content) do
#         self.default_renderer = Class.new(ActionController::Base).renderer

# = \Notifications
#
# +ActiveSupport::Notifications+ provides an instrumentation API for
# Ruby.
#
# == Instrumenters
#
# To instrument an event you just need to do:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument('render', extra: :information) do
#     render plain: 'Foo'
#   end
#
# That first executes the block and then notifies all subscribers once done.
#
# In the example above +render+ is the name of the event, and the rest is called
# the _payload_. The payload is a mechanism that allows instrumenters to pass
# extra information to subscribers. Payloads consist of a hash whose contents
# are arbitrary and generally depend on the event.
#
# == Subscribers
#
# You can consume those events and the information they provide by registering
# a subscriber.
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('render') do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
#     name    # => String, name of the event (such as 'render' from above)
#     start   # => Time, when the instrumented block started execution
#     finish  # => Time, when the instrumented block ended execution
#     id      # => String, unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
#     payload # => Hash, the payload
#   end
#
# Here, the +start+ and +finish+ values represent wall-clock time. If you are
# concerned about accuracy, you can register a monotonic subscriber.
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.monotonic_subscribe('render') do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
#     name    # => String, name of the event (such as 'render' from above)
#     start   # => Monotonic time, when the instrumented block started execution
#     finish  # => Monotonic time, when the instrumented block ended execution
#     id      # => String, unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
#     payload # => Hash, the payload
#   end
#
# The +start+ and +finish+ values above represent monotonic time.
#
# For instance, let's store all "render" events in an array:
#
#   events = []
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('render') do |*args|
#     events << ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
#   end
#
# That code returns right away, you are just subscribing to "render" events.
# The block is saved and will be called whenever someone instruments "render":
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument('render', extra: :information) do
#     render plain: 'Foo'
#   end
#
#   event = events.first
#   event.name      # => "render"
#   event.duration  # => 10 (in milliseconds)
#   event.payload   # => { extra: :information }
#
# The block in the <tt>subscribe</tt> call gets the name of the event, start
# timestamp, end timestamp, a string with a unique identifier for that event's instrumenter
# (something like "535801666f04d0298cd6"), and a hash with the payload, in
# that order.
#
# If an exception happens during that particular instrumentation the payload will
# have a key <tt>:exception</tt> with an array of two elements as value: a string with
# the name of the exception class, and the exception message.
# The <tt>:exception_object</tt> key of the payload will have the exception
# itself as the value:
#
#   event.payload[:exception]         # => ["ArgumentError", "Invalid value"]
#   event.payload[:exception_object]  # => #<ArgumentError: Invalid value>
#
# As the earlier example depicts, the class ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event
# is able to take the arguments as they come and provide an object-oriented
# interface to that data.
#
# It is also possible to pass an object which responds to <tt>call</tt> method
# as the second parameter to the <tt>subscribe</tt> method instead of a block:
#
#   module ActionController
#     class PageRequest
#       def call(name, started, finished, unique_id, payload)
#         Rails.logger.debug ['notification:', name, started, finished, unique_id, payload].join(' ')
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('process_action.action_controller', ActionController::PageRequest.new)
#
# resulting in the following output within the logs including a hash with the payload:
#
#   notification: process_action.action_controller 2012-04-13 01:08:35 +0300 2012-04-13 01:08:35 +0300 af358ed7fab884532ec7 {
#      controller: "Devise::SessionsController",
#      action: "new",
#      params: {"action"=>"new", "controller"=>"devise/sessions"},
#      format: :html,
#      method: "GET",
#      path: "/login/sign_in",
#      status: 200,
#      view_runtime: 279.3080806732178,
#      db_runtime: 40.053
#    }
#
# You can also subscribe to all events whose name matches a certain regexp:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/render/) do |*args|
#     ...
#   end
#
# and even pass no argument to <tt>subscribe</tt>, in which case you are subscribing
# to all events.
#
# == Temporary Subscriptions
#
# Sometimes you do not want to subscribe to an event for the entire life of
# the application. There are two ways to unsubscribe.
#
# WARNING: The instrumentation framework is designed for long-running subscribers,
# use this feature sparingly because it wipes some internal caches and that has
# a negative impact on performance.
#
# === Subscribe While a Block Runs
#
# You can subscribe to some event temporarily while some block runs. For
# example, in
#
#   callback = lambda {|*args| ... }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(callback, "sql.active_record") do
#     ...
#   end
#
# the callback will be called for all "sql.active_record" events instrumented
# during the execution of the block. The callback is unsubscribed automatically
# after that.
#
# To record +started+ and +finished+ values with monotonic time,
# specify the optional <tt>:monotonic</tt> option to the
# <tt>subscribed</tt> method. The <tt>:monotonic</tt> option is set
# to +false+ by default.
#
#   callback = lambda {|name, started, finished, unique_id, payload| ... }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribed(callback, "sql.active_record", monotonic: true) do
#     ...
#   end
#
# === Manual Unsubscription
#
# The +subscribe+ method returns a subscriber object:
#
#   subscriber = ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("render") do |*args|
#     ...
#   end
#
# To prevent that block from being called anymore, just unsubscribe passing
# that reference:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe(subscriber)
#
# You can also unsubscribe by passing the name of the subscriber object. Note
# that this will unsubscribe all subscriptions with the given name:
#
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe("render")
#
# Subscribers using a regexp or other pattern-matching object will remain subscribed
# to all events that match their original pattern, unless those events match a string
# passed to +unsubscribe+:
#
#   subscriber = ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/render/) { }
#   ActiveSupport::Notifications.unsubscribe('render_template.action_view')
#   subscriber.matches?('render_template.action_view') # => false
#   subscriber.matches?('render_partial.action_view') # => true
#
# == Default Queue
#
# Notifications ships with a queue implementation that consumes and publishes events
# to all log subscribers. You can use any queue implementation you want.

# = Active Support \Time Zone
#
# The TimeZone class serves as a wrapper around +TZInfo::Timezone+ instances.
# It allows us to do the following:
#
# * Limit the set of zones provided by TZInfo to a meaningful subset of 134
#   zones.
# * Retrieve and display zones with a friendlier name
#   (e.g., "Eastern Time (US & Canada)" instead of "America/New_York").
# * Lazily load +TZInfo::Timezone+ instances only when they're needed.
# * Create ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instances via TimeZone's +local+,
#   +parse+, +at+, and +now+ methods.

  #
  # ==== Options
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - Specifies the target object name as a symbol or string
  # * <tt>:prefix</tt> - Prefixes the new method with the target name or a custom prefix
  # * <tt>:allow_nil</tt> - If set to true, prevents a +Module::DelegationError+
  #   from being raised
  # * <tt>:private</tt> - If set to true, changes method visibility to private
  #
  # The macro receives one or more method names (specified as symbols or
  # strings) and the name of the target object via the <tt>:to</tt> option
  # (also a symbol or string).
  #
  # Delegation is particularly useful with Active Record associations:
  #
  #   class Greeter < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def hello
  #       'hello'
  #     end
  #
  #     def goodbye

  #
  #   Foo.new.hello   # => "hello"
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => NoMethodError: undefined method `goodbye' for #<Foo:0x1af30c>
  #
  # Multiple delegates to the same target are allowed:
  #
  #   class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, :goodbye, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => "goodbye"
  #
  # Methods can be delegated to instance variables, class variables, or constants
  # by providing them as a symbols:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     CONSTANT_ARRAY = [0,1,2,3]
  #     @@class_array  = [4,5,6,7]
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       @instance_array = [8,9,10,11]
  #     end
  #     delegate :sum, to: :CONSTANT_ARRAY
  #     delegate :min, to: :@@class_array
  #     delegate :max, to: :@instance_array
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.sum # => 6
  #   Foo.new.min # => 4
  #   Foo.new.max # => 11
  #
  # It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     def self.hello
  #       "world"
  #     end
  #
  #     delegate :hello, to: :class
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello # => "world"
  #
  # Delegates can optionally be prefixed using the <tt>:prefix</tt> option. If the value
  # is <tt>true</tt>, the delegate methods are prefixed with the name of the object being
  # delegated to.
  #
  #   Person = Struct.new(:name, :address)

  #
  #   invoice = Invoice.new(john_doe)
  #   invoice.customer_name    # => 'John Doe'

  # == Method chaining

  # object. Interoperability problems can be resolved easily with a +to_s+ call.
